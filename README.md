# [Demo of Pixel Art App](https://asar-pixart.netlify.app)

## Descriptions

Pixel Art is a dynamic app designed for creating pixel-based artwork with ease. Whether you're an artist, designer, or simply enjoy pixel art, this app provides a versatile canvas and a range of useful tools to bring your imagination to life.

The app features a Dark/Light mode button, allowing users to switch between different color themes based on their preference. Additionally, there's a draggable color palette button that provides a convenient way to select and apply colors to the canvas. Users can also toggle the visibility of the grid borders using the show/hide grid border button, providing flexibility in working with or without a grid.

For enhanced functionality, Pixel Art offers a transparent button for exporting artwork as PNG files with transparency support. Users can easily download their creations using the download button. The app also includes a bucket button, enabling users to apply colors to a clicked pixel and its neighboring pixels with the same color. The brush button, on the other hand, allows users to color only the selected pixel for precise editing.

To facilitate easy editing, Pixel Art provides an undo button to revert the last action and an undo all button to reset the canvas completely. Users can also choose from preset pixel dimensions like 8x8, 16x16, or customize their own pixel dimensions using the pixel number select panel.

Pixel Art utilizes popular libraries and frameworks such as React, Redux, and Material-UI for a robust and seamless user experience. With its rich set of features and user-friendly interface, Pixel Art is the perfect companion for pixel artists and enthusiasts looking to express their creativity.
